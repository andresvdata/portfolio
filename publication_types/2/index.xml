      <description>&lt;p&gt;The effects of aeration rate and agitation speed on the production of Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA’s) by
Burkholderia cepacia B27 in a batch fermenter were investigated. Central composite design (CCD) technique
was used to develop an empirical model to find the best hydrodynamic conditions to demonstrate the high
influence of rheological culture over biomass production and PHA accumulation. The agitation speed and
aeration rates were between 120 to 515 rpm and 4.3 to 22 𝐿 𝑚𝑖𝑛−1
, respectively. This values range was
selected due to the aeration and agitation restriction of bioreactor. A dynamic method was applied to measure
the volumetric oxygen mass transfer, which has a critical influence on biomass development on the overall
process. Results revealed the agitation was the most important factor to PHAs accumulation. Furthermore,
other parameters including bacteria growth was affected by the mass transfer, dissolved oxygen and broth
viscosity, therefore agitation speed and aeration rate had a significant effect over strain and its production
efficiency. Maximum PHA’s concentration reached was 8.72 𝑔 𝐿
−1 at 24 h of fermentation time with aeration
rate and agitation speed at 13.5 𝐿 𝑚𝑖𝑛−1 and 310 rpm, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
